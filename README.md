Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

ans: 
The evolution of software engineering has been marked by several key milestones that have shaped the field. Here are three significant ones:

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968):
The term "software engineering" was popularized during the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference highlighted the need for a more disciplined approach to software development due to the growing complexity of software systems. It marked a shift from ad-hoc coding practices to a more structured and systematic approach, leading to the establishment of software engineering as a distinct field of study and practice.
2. The Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s):
In the early 1970s, the Waterfall model was introduced by Winston W. Royce. This model provided a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase (requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) had to be completed before moving on to the next. While later criticized for its rigidity, the Waterfall model was one of the first formal methodologies for managing software development and laid the groundwork for future methodologies.
3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001):
The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, was a groundbreaking milestone in software engineering. It introduced a set of principles emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback over rigid planning and documentation. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote iterative development, adaptive planning, and continuous improvement. This shift from traditional methodologies like Waterfall to Agile practices has significantly influenced how software is developed and managed, leading to more responsive and customer-centric software development processes.
These milestones reflect the growing sophistication in managing software development and the ongoing efforts to improve both the process and the quality of software systems.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Ans: 
1. Requirement Analysis: This phase involves gathering and analyzing the needs and requirements of the stakeholders. The goal is to understand what the software should do and document these requirements clearly.
2. System Design: Based on the requirements, this phase involves creating the architecture and design of the system. It includes defining the system's overall structure, user interfaces, data models, and algorithms.
3. Implementation (or Coding): In this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. It involves translating design documents into functional software components.
4. Testing: This phase involves verifying that the software works correctly and meets the requirements. Various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are performed to identify and fix defects.
5. Deployment: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to the production environment where it becomes available to users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and training.
6. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues, bugs are fixed, and updates or enhancements are made as needed.
Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring that the final software product is reliable, functional, and meets user needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Ans:
-Waterfall Methodology:
• Approach: Linear and sequential. Each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next.
